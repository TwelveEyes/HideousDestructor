			  Note: It is strongly recommended that you go into your GZDoom
			  settings and set your channels to as many as your computer can handle.

Description             : Changes some monster, weapon, and player behaviours for a slightly
			  different game experience, in addition to some cosmetic changes.
			  Normally any individual zombie's purpose is not to pose an immediate
			  threat, but to nibble away at a player's resources to make their
			  prospects for the next encounter just a little bit worse. This wad
			  changes things to put more focus on the individual encounter, giving
			  you more ammo and regenerating health at the cost of much more lethal
			  enemies the least of whom is quite capable of killing you if you're
			  not careful.

			  In short: Think the final shootout from The Way of the Gun, and then
			  throw in some fire-spitting monsters.

			  Please see hd_manual.md for detailed instructions.

* Construction *

Base/Rips               :
	Earlier DECORATE work started off as modified Doom definitions posted on the ZDoom Wiki.
	Numerous things ripped straight off of GZDoom internal ZScript.
	See credits.txt for a proper list.
Inspiration             :
	Project title, of course, from the Judas Priest lyrics.
	Gameplay heavily influenced by the final firefight in "The Way of the Gun" (2000).
	Also of note is the 2006 Casino Royale remake, as an idea of what sort of changes were made.
	Health system inspired by the Opera Half-Life mod.
	Babuin originally inspired by the discussion on pit bull size in the Intuitor review of The Hulk.
		More insultingly stupid movie physics: http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/
	Weapons partially inspired by the Infiltration UT Mod.
		http://infiltration.sentrystudios.net/
	Quite a few DECORATE implementations (and idea for the BFG) taken from eliw00d's GZDoom Advanced.
		http://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=15537
	Portable medikits and stimpacks stolen from Ryan Cordell's Demon Wars.
